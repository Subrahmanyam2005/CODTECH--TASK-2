ðŸ”§ Key Features:

Dynamic Grade Input: The user can continuously input grades for different subjects or assignments. The input is flexible, and the program validates that grades are within a valid range (0-100).

Average Grade Calculation: Once grades are input, the program calculates the average grade dynamically using a simple loop.

Letter Grade Assignment: Based on the calculated average, the program assigns a letter grade (A, B, C, D, or F), helping users instantly understand their performance.

GPA Calculation: The GPA is calculated on a 4.0 scale, matching the average grade to its corresponding GPA score, making it easy to evaluate academic performance.

Detailed Report: At the end, the system provides a clean, detailed summary of the student's performance, showing the average grade, letter grade, and GPA.


ðŸ–¥ Why This Project Was Important:

This project helped me practice:

Data collection and validation using lists and conditionals

Iterative calculations to process data and calculate averages

Conditional logic to map numerical averages to letter grades and GPA

User interaction by providing a clear, user-friendly console interface


Hereâ€™s a quick snippet of the user experience:
